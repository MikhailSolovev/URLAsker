### Get Started


### Contracts
Project has several public contracts: [swagger]() 

### Build

`make run`

`make stop`

`make stop-clean-volumes`

### Some thoughts
Maybe it's more convenient to use clickhouse instead postgres,
therefore clickhouse is better on aggregations, which can be useful
for future analytics.
